# 2D Array 

A 2D array or Matrix has a type such as int[][] or String[][], with two pairs of square brackets. The elements of a 2D array are arranged in rows and columns

### Exercises

* Ex01: A program that request a matrix and realize a sum with itself.

* Ex02: A program that request a matrix and realize a matrix multiplication with itself.

* Ex03: A program that request a 3x3 matrix and transpose that matrix.

* Ex04: A program that scans an integer N that will be the size of the matrix, scans an integer for each element of the matrix and prints it.

* Ex05: A program that will fill a 5x5 matrix with random numbers between 10 and 100(using `rand()` & time.h lib) and print that matrix.

* Ex06: A program that will fill a 6x6 matrix with random numbers between 0 and 10, realize a sum with main diagonal and secundary diagonal and print that matrix and the results of the sums.

* Ex07: A program that will fill 2 5x5 matrices(A and B) with different random numbers between 0 and 10, print that 2 matrices, realize a sum between them and print that resulted matrix(C).

* Ex08: A program that will fill a 5x5 matrix with random numbers between 1 and 10, scans a integer number N and verify:
      
     * If N == 0, replace main diagonal elements by 0 and print that matrix.
     * If N is even, replace the elements above main diagonal by 0 and print that matrix.
     * If N is odd , replace the elements below main diagonal by 0 and print that matrix.
